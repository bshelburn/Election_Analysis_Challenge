## Overview of Election Audit
Performed an electtion audit for Seth, Tom and the Colorado Board of Elections.   Results were housed within a .csv file containing the Ballot ID, County, and Candidate names.   Python was utilized to parse out and calculate the needed metrics held within the imported .csv file as well as create the outputs shown in both the terminal and a .txt file.

My reccomendation for Steve's parents would be to take a closer look at both ENPH and RUN for investments.   It would be wise to do a similar analysis for 2019 and 2020 data.
