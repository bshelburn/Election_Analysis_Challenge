## Overview of Election Audit
Performed an electtion audit for Seth, Tom and the Colorado Board of Elections.   Results were housed within a .csv file containing the Ballot ID, County, and Candidate names.   Python was utilized to parse out and calculate the needed metrics held within the imported .csv file as well as create the outputs shown in both the terminal and a .txt file.

### Purpose
This audit was needed by the Colorado Board of Elections to determine the total number of votes cast, all candidates who received votes, total number of votes received per candidate, percentage of total votes each candidate received, which county the votes were cast in, total votes for each county, percentage of total votes per county, whouch county had the highest turnout for the election, and the winner based on the popular vote with percentage of total votes.

## Election Audit Results

## Election Audit Summary
My reccomendation for Steve's parents would be to take a closer look at both ENPH and RUN for investments.   It would be wise to do a similar analysis for 2019 and 2020 data.
